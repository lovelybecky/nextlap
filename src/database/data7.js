	data1:"We are a student care centre that champions holistic approach to development and growth of school going children. We provide quality care and capable academic assistance to your child. We aim to do well by doing good and to create a better world for our future generations.",
	parent1:"Being working parents, we feel easier at work by knowing our child is with The Next Lap teachers. As they will fetch my boy from school, serve him the food and guide him with his homework which release so much of the patents’ burden. And they are also helping with my son’s character building by correcting his impropriate behaviours and attitudes. I can see his improvement and I appreciate that.",
	parent2:"I’m quite satisfied with The Next Lap student care centre environment. As they are not only providing a place for the children to stay but also providing them a very cozy and spacious environment to study, eat and play. Whenever there are school holidays, they always arrange some fun activities for them like tennis, dancing, handcraft and drawing, etc.",
	parent3:"I’m very thankful that the centre teachers have been guiding my daughter with her homework and ensure that it is completed correctly. It is a big relief for the parents indeed. And another thing that I like The Next Lap is the character-building values pass on to the kids like greeting each other, respect, responsibility and compassion. They make my daughter more positive and confident than before.",
